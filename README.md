# Getting Started (Alan)
This is the skeleton for the BarQ front-end, including the setup of the AirBnB linter and a stylelintrc file for CSS linting. 

The .gitignore at the root is configured to exclude node_modules from your commits.

I propose that we use [Commitizen](http://commitizen.github.io/cz-cli/) for our commits. Please install it globally and make your commits with `git cz` instead of `git commit` to make our commits styled in the same way.j

Initial dockerfiles are included as well - let's discuss if and how we want to leverage Docker.

## How to install
- docker
- environment variables
- package.json settings
