## screenshots (Copy from landing page)
BarQ allows you to order and pay for drinks from your phone wherever you are in the bar. No more fighting through crowds and waiting to catch a bartenders' attention. Browse the menu and place your order without leaving your seat. Youâ€™ll be notified as soon as your order is ready to pick up.



Landing Page

BarQ provides a user friendly interface for bar owners to manage different menus across multiple bars, all in one place.

A live feed of current orders shows you what to prepare next. You can update the status of orders with one click, sending live updates to let your customer know when their drink is ready.

# Getting Started (Alan)
This is the skeleton for the BarQ front-end, including the setup of the AirBnB linter and a stylelintrc file for CSS linting. 

The .gitignore at the root is configured to exclude node_modules from your commits.

I propose that we use [Commitizen](http://commitizen.github.io/cz-cli/) for our commits. Please install it globally and make your commits with `git cz` instead of `git commit` to make our commits styled in the same way.j

Initial dockerfiles are included as well - let's discuss if and how we want to leverage Docker.

## How to install
- docker
- environment variables
- package.json settings
